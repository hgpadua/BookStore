Huey's e-Store for Books!

Java program that simulates an e-store which allows the user to add items (books) to 
a shopping cart and once all items are included, total costs (including tax), 
produces an invoice, and append to a transaction log file.


---To run the project from the command line---

java -jar "bookStore.jar"
